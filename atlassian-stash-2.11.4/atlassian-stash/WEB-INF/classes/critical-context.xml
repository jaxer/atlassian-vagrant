         These represent "critical" components. Components which are used heavily throughout the rest of the system
         and whose initialisation needs to be rigidly controlled to enforce ordering.

         DO NOT USE AUTOWIRING OR COMPONENT SCANNING FOR ANY BEANS IN THIS SECTION. All dependencies must be explicitly
         written in XML to ensure Spring doesn't perform initialisation out of order. Beans in this file should not use
         dependencies which are not declared in this file.

         Component scanning and autowiring have undocumented (and largely unexpected) behaviours, especially in how they
         interact with FactoryBeans in the context. When a property is @Autowired into a bean, Spring searches through
         the entire ApplicationContext for candidates suitable to be wired in. When it encounters any singleton factory
         beans, _it eagerly initialises them_ so it can get their beans to determine their types. That initialisation
         may trigger the initialisation of other beans. For example, the FactoryBean for our plugin configuration will
         trigger the initialisation of the PluginStateDao, which triggers Hibernate, which triggers Liquibase, which
         triggers the DataSource. As this clearly illustrates, dependency hoisting can result in sweeping (and difficult
         to debug!) changes in the overall initialisation order for the web application. This also manifests around AOP
         interceptors, which are also very eagerly instantiated and can hoist any dependencies they have.

         It appears that, when eagerly initialising these hoisted dependencies, component scanned and autowired beans
         which throw exceptions may end up being instantiated and initialised multiple times. This causes problems for
         the HomeLockAcquirer, which is intended to be strictly a singleton.

         So, in summation: No component scanning; No autowiring. Explicit XML only. You have been warned!

    <!-- These must always be the first two bean definitions, and they must exist before any imports to ensure they are
         fully processed before any beans contained in other XML files, and they may not have any hard dependencies.

         Specifically, for future reference, there is code in PluginBeanDefinitionRegistry, which is part of the plugin
         framework, which inspects the Spring context for the presence of a bean named "hostComponentProvider" and, if
         one is not found, adds one automatically. That code is triggered while processing bean definitions which are
         marked as <plugin:available>true</plugin:available>. As a result, these definitions must exist before those of
         any bean which will be available to the plugin system or the registry will add a conflicting provider.

         To prevent initialisation ordering issues, the accessor (which is really the plugin framework itself) and the
         event manager are injected as names only. They are not actually needed by the provider until the framework is
         being initialised, which happens after the ApplicationContext is started and refreshed, so there is no danger
         in injecting them by name and looking them up from the ApplicationContext later. -->
