 * There is a bug in IE8 with how it handles max-width in conjunction with truncation (it truncates the text, but the element is still the full width).
 * Using max-width on the changeset-id is a work around for animating the transition between short and full SHA, because you can't animate the transition to width auto.
 * IE8 doesn't have transitions so it doesn't lose anything by just using width: auto.
