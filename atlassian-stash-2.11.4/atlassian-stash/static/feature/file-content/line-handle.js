     * in terms of line type and line number in a diff, but still reference one of those indexed lines when talking to CodeMirror.
     *
     * The lineInfos are deeply frozen so they can be passed around publicly without any danger.

     * @param {string} lineType - the line type to reference (context, added, or removed)
     * @param {number} lineNumber - the line number to reference (the file to reference - source or target - depends on the lineType)
     * @param {Object} handle - an internal CodeMirror LineHandle to link to.
